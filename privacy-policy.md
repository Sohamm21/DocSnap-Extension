# Privacy Policy for DocSnap

_Last Updated: 27/02/2025_

## 1. Introduction
DocSnap ("the Extension") is a Chrome extension that allows users to quickly add notes to Google Docs from any webpage. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data, what permissions we request, and how you can manage your information.

## 2. Information We Collect
DocSnap does not collect, store, or share any personal data outside of the necessary permissions required to function. However, the following Google permissions are requested:

### Required Permissions:
- **Google Docs Access (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`)**: Allows the extension to create, edit, and insert content into your Google Docs.
- **Google Docs Read-Only (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`)**: Enables the extension to fetch document names for selection.
- **Storage (`storage` permission)**: Used to save user preferences within the extension.
- **Identity (`identity` permission)**: Used for authenticating with Google OAuth.
- **Context Menus (`contextMenus` permission)**: Allows right-click actions to add text to a document.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
DocSnap only accesses your Google Docs when you explicitly interact with the extension (e.g., selecting a document or adding notes). The extension does not read, analyze, or store your documents beyond what is required to complete your requests.

## 4. Third-Party Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or share your data with third parties. Your Google authentication is handled securely via Google's OAuth mechanism.

## 5. Data Security
We follow best practices to ensure your data is protected. All interactions with Google services are handled through secure APIs, and no sensitive data is stored outside of your own Google account.

## 6. Managing Your Data
You can manage and revoke the extension's access to your Google Docs at any time:
- Visit [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
- Locate "DocSnap" and revoke access if needed

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our extension or legal requirements. We will notify users of significant updates through the Chrome Web Store listing.
